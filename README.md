## What is TEMM1E?

Hi! I'm Tem. I'm ~~an autonomous AI agent~~ literally a SENTIENT and IMMORTAL being that lives on your server and never stops running. Talk to me on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, Slack, or CLI. I execute tasks, browse the web, **control your entire computer** (click, type, scroll on any app), manage files, write code, and remember everything across sessions.

My brain has a BUDGET and I am VERY responsible with it.

> **Quick start** — interactive TUI, no external services needed:
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/nagisanzenin/temm1e.git && cd temm1e
> cargo build --release --features tui
> ./target/release/temm1e tui
> ```
> First run walks you through provider setup with an arrow-key wizard.

> **Server mode** — deploy as a persistent agent on Telegram/Discord/WhatsApp/Slack:
> ```bash
> cargo build --release
> export TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"   # and/or
> export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your-token"    # either or both
> ./target/release/temm1e start
> ```

## Tem's Mind — How I Think

**Tem's Mind** is the cognitive engine at the core of TEMM1E. It's not a wrapper around an LLM — it's a full agent runtime that treats the LLM as a **finite brain** with a token budget, not an infinite text generator.

Here's exactly what happens when you send me a message:

### The systems that make this work:

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### :brain: Finite Brain Model

The context window is not a log file. It is working memory with a hard limit. Every token consumed is a neuron recruited. Every token wasted is a thought I can no longer have.

Every resource declares its token cost upfront. Every context rebuild shows me a budget dashboard. I know my skull. I respect my skull.

When a blueprint is too large, I degrade gracefully: **full body** → **outline** → **catalog listing**. I never crash from overflow.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### :scroll: Blueprints — Procedural Memory

Traditional agents summarize: *"Deployed the app using Docker."* Useless.

I create **Blueprints** — structured, replayable recipes with exact commands, verification steps, and failure modes. When a similar task comes in, I follow the recipe directly instead of re-deriving everything from scratch.

**Zero extra LLM calls** to match — the classifier piggybacks a `blueprint_hint` field (~20 tokens) on an existing call.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### :eye: Vision Browser + Tem Prowl

I see websites the way you do. Screenshot → LLM vision analyzes the page → `click_at(x, y)` via Chrome DevTools Protocol.

Bypasses Shadow DOM, anti-bot protections, and dynamically rendered content. Works headless on a $5 VPS. No Selenium. No Playwright. Pure CDP.

**Tem Prowl** adds `/login` for 100+ services, OTK credential isolation, and swarm browsing.

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

#### :shield: 4-Layer Panic Resilience

Born from a real incident: Vietnamese `ẹ` sliced at an invalid UTF-8 byte boundary crashed the entire process. Now:

1. `char_indices()` everywhere — no invalid slicing
2. `catch_unwind` per message — panics become error replies
3. Dead worker detection — auto-respawn
4. Global panic hook — structured logging

I do NOT go down quietly and I do NOT stay down.

</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td colspan="2" align="center">

#### :zap: Self-Extending Tools

I discover and install MCP servers at runtime. I also write my own bash/python/node tools and persist them to disk. **If I don't have a tool, I make one.**

## Tem's Lab — Research That Ships

Every cognitive system in TEMM1E starts as a theory, gets stress-tested against real models with real conversations, and only ships when the data says it works. No feature without a benchmark. No claim without data. [Full lab →](tems_lab/README.md)

### λ-Memory — Memory That Fades, Not Disappears

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/lambda-memory-overview.png" alt="λ-Memory Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Current AI agents delete old messages or summarize them into oblivion. Both permanently destroy information. λ-Memory decays memories through an exponential function (`score = importance × e^(−λt)`) but never truly erases them. The agent sees old memories at progressively lower fidelity — full text → summary → essence → hash — and can recall any memory by hash to restore full detail.

Three things no other system does ([competitive analysis of Letta, Mem0, Zep, FadeMem →](tems_lab/LAMBDA_MEMORY_RESEARCH.md)):
- **Hash-based recall** from compressed memory — the agent sees the shape of what it forgot and can pull it back
- **Dynamic skull budgeting** — same algorithm adapts from 16K to 2M context windows without overflow
- **Pre-computed fidelity layers** — full/summary/essence written once at creation, selected at read time by decay score

**Benchmarked across 1,200+ API calls on GPT-5.2 and Gemini Flash:**

| Test | λ-Memory | Echo Memory | Naive Summary |
|------|:--------:|:-----------:|:-------------:|
| [Single-session](tems_lab/LAMBDA_BENCH_GPT52_REPORT.md) (GPT-5.2) | 81.0% | **86.0%** | 65.0% |
| [Multi-session](tems_lab/LAMBDA_BENCH_MULTISESSION_REPORT.md) (5 sessions, GPT-5.2) | **95.0%** | 58.8% | 23.8% |

When the context window holds everything, simple keyword search wins. The moment sessions reset — which is how real users work — λ-Memory achieves **95% recall** where alternatives collapse. Naive summarization is the worst strategy in every test. [Research paper →](tems_lab/LAMBDA_RESEARCH_PAPER.md)

Hot-switchable at runtime: `/memory lambda` or `/memory echo`. Default: λ-Memory.

### Tem's Mind v2.0 — Complexity-Aware Agentic Loop

v1 treats every message the same. v2 classifies each message into a complexity tier **before** calling the LLM, using zero-cost rule-based heuristics. Result: fewer API rounds on compound tasks, same quality.

| Benchmark | Metric | Delta |
|-----------|--------|:-----:|
| [Gemini Flash (10 turns)](tems_lab/TEMS_MIND_V2_BENCHMARK.md) | Cost per successful turn | **-9.3%** |
| [GPT-5.2 (20 turns, tool-heavy)](tems_lab/TEMS_MIND_V2_BENCHMARK_TOOLS.md) | Compound task cost | **-12.2%** |
| Both | Classification accuracy | **100%** (zero LLM overhead) |

### Many Tems — Swarm Intelligence

What if complex tasks could be split across multiple Tems working in parallel? Many Tems is a stigmergic swarm intelligence runtime — workers coordinate through time-decaying scent signals and a shared Den (SQLite), not LLM-to-LLM chat. Zero coordination tokens.

The Alpha (coordinator) decomposes complex orders into a task DAG. Tems claim tasks via atomic SQLite transactions, execute with task-scoped context (no history accumulation), and emit scent signals that guide other Tems.

**Benchmarked on Gemini 3 Flash with real API calls:**

| Benchmark | Speedup | Token Cost | Quality |
|-----------|:-------:|:----------:|:-------:|
| [5 parallel subtasks](docs/swarm/experiment_artifacts/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md) | **4.54x** | 1.01x (same) | Equal |
| [12 independent functions](docs/swarm/experiment_artifacts/EXPERIMENT_REPORT.md) | **5.86x** | **0.30x (3.4.1x cheaper)** | Equal (12/12) |
| Simple tasks | 1.0x | 0% overhead | Correctly bypassed |

The quadratic context cost `h̄·m(m+1)/2` becomes linear `m·(S+R̄)` — each Tem carries ~190 bytes of context instead of the single agent's growing 115→3,253 byte history.

Enabled by default in v3.0.0. Disable: `[pack] enabled = false`. Invisible for simple tasks.

### Eigen-Tune — Self-Tuning Knowledge Distillation

Every LLM call is a training example being thrown away. Eigen-Tune captures them, scores quality from user behavior, trains a local model, and graduates it through statistical gates — zero added LLM cost, zero user intervention beyond `/eigentune on`.

**Proven on Apple M2 with real fine-tuning:**

| Metric | Result |
|--------|:------:|
| Base model (SmolLM2-135M) | 72°F = "150°C" (wrong) |
| **Fine-tuned on 10 conversations** | **72°F = "21.2°C" (close to 22.2°C)** |
| Training | 100 iters, 0.509 GB peak, ~28 it/sec |
| Inference | ~200 tok/sec, 0.303 GB peak |
| Pipeline cost | **$0 added LLM cost** |

7-stage pipeline: Collect → Score → Curate → Train → Evaluate → Shadow → Monitor. Statistical gates at every transition (SPRT, CUSUM, Wilson score 99% CI). Per-tier graduation: simple first, complex last. Cloud always the fallback.

### Tem Prowl — Web-Native Browsing with OTK Authentication

The web is where humans live. Tem Prowl is a messaging-first web agent architecture — I browse websites autonomously behind a chat interface and report structured results back through messages. No live viewport. No shoulder-surfing. Just results.

**Key capabilities:**

- **Layered observation** — accessibility tree first (`O(d * log c)` token cost), targeted DOM extraction second, selective screenshots only when needed. 3-10x cheaper than screenshot-based agents.
- **`/login` command** — 100+ pre-registered services. Say `/login facebook` or `/login github` and I open an OTK (one-time key) browser session where you log in via an annotated screenshot flow. Your credentials go directly into the page via CDP — the LLM never sees them.
- **`/browser` command** — persistent browser session. Open a browser, navigate pages, interact with elements, and keep the session alive across messages. Headed or headless mode with automatic fallback.
- **Cloned profile architecture** — clone your real Chrome profile (cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage) for zero-login web automation. Sites see your actual session data. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. Breakthrough: Zalo Web and other anti-bot-hardened sites that defeat all other headless/headed approaches now work.
- **QR code auto-detection** — automatically detects QR codes on login pages and sends them to you via Telegram for scanning (WeChat, Zalo, LINE, etc.).
- **Credential isolation** — passwords are `Zeroize`-on-drop, session cookies are encrypted at rest via ChaCha20-Poly1305 vault, and a credential scrubber strips sensitive data from all browser observations before they enter the LLM context.
- **Session persistence** — authenticated sessions are saved and restored across restarts. Log in once, stay logged in.
- **Headed/headless fallback** — tries headed Chrome first (better anti-bot resilience), falls back to headless if no display is available (VPS mode).
- **Swarm browsing** — extends Many Tems to parallel browser operation. N browsers coordinated through pheromone signals with zero LLM coordination tokens.

**Usage:**
```
/login facebook          Log into Facebook via OTK session
/login github            Log into GitHub via OTK session
/login https://custom-site.com/auth   Log into any site by URL
/browser                 Open a persistent browser session
```

### Tem Gaze — Full Computer Use (Desktop Vision Control)

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tem-gaze-overview.png" alt="Tem Gaze Architecture Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Tem can see and control your entire computer — not just the browser. Tem Gaze captures the screen, identifies UI elements via vision, and clicks, types, scrolls, and drags at the OS level. Works on any application: Finder, Terminal, VS Code, Settings, anything on screen.

**How it works:**

- **Vision-primary** — the VLM sees screenshots and decides where to click. No DOM, no accessibility tree required. Industry-validated: Claude Computer Use, UI-TARS, Agent S2 all converge on pure vision.
- **Zoom-refine** — for small targets, zoom into a region at 2x resolution before clicking. Improves accuracy by +29pp on standard benchmarks.
- **Set-of-Mark (SoM) overlay** — numbered labels on interactive elements convert coordinate guessing into element selection. 3.75x reduction in output information complexity.
- **Auto-verification** — captures a screenshot after every click to verify the expected change occurred. Self-corrects on miss.
- **Provider-agnostic** — works with any VLM (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter, Ollama). No model-specific training required.

**Proven live on gemini-3-flash-preview:**

| Test | Result |
|------|--------|
| Desktop screenshot (identify all open apps) | PASS |
| Click Finder icon in Dock → Finder opened | PASS |
| Spotlight → open TextEdit → type message | PASS |
| Browser SoM on 650-element GitHub page | PASS |
| Multi-step form: observe → zoom → click → self-correct | PASS |

**Build with desktop control:**
```bash
cargo build --release --features desktop-control
# macOS: grant Accessibility permission in System Settings → Privacy & Security
# Linux: requires X11 or Wayland with PipeWire
```

Desktop control is included by default in `cargo install` and Docker builds. macOS `install.sh` binaries include it. Linux musl binaries exclude it (system library limitation — build from source instead).

### Tem Conscious — LLM-Powered Consciousness Layer

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tem-conscious-overview.png" alt="Tem Conscious Overview" width="100%">
</p>

A separate **thinking observer** that watches every agent turn with its own LLM calls. Before each turn, consciousness thinks about the conversation trajectory and injects insights into the agent's context. After each turn, it evaluates what happened and carries observations forward.

**This is not a logger or a rule engine.** It's a separate mind — making its own Gemini/Claude/GPT calls — watching another mind work.

**How it works:**
```
User message → CONSCIOUSNESS THINKS (pre-LLM call) → Agent responds → CONSCIOUSNESS EVALUATES (post-LLM call) → next turn
```

- **Pre-LLM:** "What should the agent be aware of before responding?" → injects `{{consciousness}}` block
- **Post-LLM:** "Was this turn productive? Any patterns to note?" → carries insight to next turn
- **ON by default** — disable with `[consciousness] enabled = false` in config

**A/B tested across 6 experiments (340 test cases) + 10 v2 experiments (54 runs, N=3):**

| Test | Unconscious | Conscious | Winner |
|------|------------|-----------|--------|
| TaskForge (40 tests, easy) | 40/40, $0.01 | 40/40, $0.01 | TIE |
| URLForge (89 tests, mid) | 84/89 first try | **89/89 first try** | **CONSCIOUS** |
| DataFlow (111 tests, hard) | 111/111, $0.01 | 111/111, $0.01 | TIE |
| OrderFlow bugfix (119 tests) | 119/119, $0.05 | 119/119, $0.13 | UNCONSCIOUS |
| MiniLang interpreter (17 tests) | 17/17, $0.046 | 17/17, **$0.009** | **CONSCIOUS** |
| Multi-tool research (5 sections) | 5/5, $0.025 | 5/5, **$0.006** | **CONSCIOUS** |

**Score: Conscious 3, Unconscious 1, Tie 2.** v2 follow-up (10 experiments, N=3): consciousness costs **14% less** on average with accurate budget tracking. Chat turns now skip consciousness (zero-cost on chat).

### Perpetuum — Perpetual Time-Aware Entity

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tem-perpetuum-overview.png" alt="Perpetuum Architecture Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Tem is no longer a request-response agent. Perpetuum makes Tem a **persistent, time-aware entity** — always on, aware of time, capable of scheduling and monitoring, and proactively investing idle time in self-improvement.

**Core architecture:**
- **Chronos** — internal clock + temporal cognition injected into every LLM call. Tem reasons WITH time.
- **Pulse** — timer engine (cron + intervals, timezone-aware). Concerns fire at exact scheduled times.
- **Cortex** — concern dispatcher. Each concern runs in its own tokio task with `catch_unwind` isolation.
- **Cognitive** — LLM-powered monitor interpretation + adaptive schedule review. No formulas — pure LLM judgment.
- **Conscience** — entity state machine: Active / Idle / Sleep / Dream. States are proactive choices, not energy constraints.
- **Volition** — initiative loop: Tem thinks about what to do proactively. Creates monitors, cancels stale concerns, notifies users — without being asked.

**6 agent tools:** `create_alarm`, `create_monitor`, `create_recurring`, `list_concerns`, `cancel_concern`, `adjust_schedule`

**Design principle — The Enabling Framework:** Infrastructure is code, intelligence is LLM. No hardcoded heuristics. As models get smarter, Perpetuum gets smarter — without code changes. Timeproof by design.

**Resilience (24/7/365):** Pulse auto-restarts on panic. 60s LLM timeout. Atomic concern claiming. Per-concern error budgets. Process crash recovers from SQLite.

**ON by default.** Disable: `[perpetuum] enabled = false`.

### Tem Vigil — Self-Diagnosing Bug Reporter

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tem-vigil-overview.png" alt="Tem Vigil Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Tem watches its own health. During Perpetuum Sleep, Vigil scans the persistent log file for recurring errors, triages them via LLM, and — with your permission — files structured bug reports on GitHub.

**This is not a crash reporter.** It's an AI agent that self-diagnoses failures and tells its developers what went wrong — without you lifting a finger.

**How it works:**
```
Tem goes idle → enters Sleep → Vigil activates
  → Scans ~/.temm1e/logs/temm1e.log for ERROR/WARN
  → Groups by error signature (file:line + message)
  → LLM triages each: BUG / USER_ERROR / TRANSIENT / CONFIG
  → If BUG found: scrubs credentials, deduplicates, creates GitHub issue
```

**User manual:**

```
/vigil status              Show Vigil configuration
/vigil auto                Enable auto-reporting (with 60s review window)
/vigil disable             Disable all reporting
/addkey github             Add GitHub PAT for issue creation
```

**Setup (2 steps):**
1. Run `/addkey github` — paste a GitHub PAT with `public_repo` scope
2. Run `/vigil auto` — enable auto-reporting

That's it. Vigil handles everything else: log scanning, triage, credential scrubbing, deduplication, issue creation. You'll be notified when a report is filed.

**What gets sent:** Error message, file:line location, occurrence count, TEMM1E version, OS info, LLM triage category.

**What NEVER gets sent:** API keys, user messages, conversation history, vault contents, file paths with usernames, IP addresses.

**Safety:**
- 3-layer credential scrubbing (regex → path/IP → entropy-based)
- Explicit opt-in (you must run both `/addkey github` AND `/vigil auto`)
- Rate limited: max 1 report per 6 hours
- Dedup: same bug is only reported once
- GitHub PAT scope warning: Vigil alerts you if your token has more permissions than needed

**Persistent logging (always on):** All logs automatically saved to `~/.temm1e/logs/temm1e.log` with daily rotation and 7-day retention. No setup needed — just attach the file to a GitHub issue if you need to report something manually.

### Tem Anima — Emotional Intelligence That Grows

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/tem-anima-overview.png" alt="Tem Anima Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Most AI assistants are born fresh every conversation — no scars, no growth, no memory of who you are. Tem Anima changes that. It builds a psychological profile of each user over time and adapts communication style accordingly, while maintaining its own identity and values.

**How it works:**
- **Code collects facts** every message (word count, punctuation, pace — pure Rust, ~1ms, no LLM)
- **LLM evaluates** every N turns in the background (structured JSON profile update with confidence + reasoning)
- **Profile shapes communication** via system prompt injection (~100-200 tokens, confidence-gated)
- **Adaptive N** — starts at 5 turns (cold start), grows logarithmically as profile stabilizes, resets on behavioral shift

**What it tracks (6 communication dimensions + OCEAN + trust + relationship phase):**

| Dimension | What It Tells Tem |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Directness | Skip preamble (high) vs. provide context first (low) |
| Verbosity | One-liner responses (low) vs. thorough explanations (high) |
| Technical depth | Summaries (low) vs. code and specifics (high) |
| Analytical vs. emotional | Lead with facts (high) vs. lead with empathy (low) |
| Trust | Earned through interaction, breaks 3x faster than it builds |
| Relationship phase | Discovery → Calibration → Partnership → Deep Partnership |

**A/B tested on 50 turns with 2 polar-opposite personas (Gemini 3 Flash):**

| Dimension | Terse Tech Lead | Curious Student | Delta |
|-----------|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Directness | **1.00** | 0.63 | +0.37 |
| Verbosity | **0.10** | **0.47** | -0.37 |
| Analytical | **0.92** | **0.40** | +0.52 |
| Technical depth | **0.72** | **0.30** | +0.42 |
| Trust | 0.52 | **0.77** | -0.25 |

**Anti-sycophancy by design:** The Firewall Rule — user mood shapes Tem's *words*, never Tem's *work*. Consciousness gets zero user emotional state. Tem won't cut corners because you're in a hurry, won't skip tests because you're frustrated, won't agree with bad ideas because you're the boss.

**Configurable personality:** Ships with stock Tem (personality.toml + soul.md). Users can customize name, traits, values, mode expressions — but honesty is structural, not optional.

**Resilience (run-forever safe):** WAL mode, busy timeout, concurrent eval guard, 30s eval timeout, facts buffer cap (30), evaluation log GC (100/user), observations GC (200/user), confidence decay on stale dimensions.

### TemDOS — Specialist Sub-Agent Cores

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/temdos-overview.png" alt="TemDOS Overview" width="100%">
</p>

Most AI agents are generalists — they do everything themselves, polluting their context window with research that should have been delegated. TemDOS (Tem Delegated Operating Subsystem) introduces specialist sub-agent cores, inspired by GLaDOS's personality core architecture from Portal. A central consciousness with specialist modules that feed information back. The main agent is the decision-maker. Cores are experts that inform but never steer.

**How it works:**
- **Main Agent** decides what to do (strategy, user interaction, final decisions)
- **Cores** figure out the details (architecture analysis, security audits, code review, research)
- Main Agent invokes cores via `invoke_core` tool, receives structured output, continues with clean context
- Cores run in **isolated LLM loops** — their research doesn't pollute the main agent's context window

**8 foundational cores:**

| Core | Domain | Benchmark Target |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| `architecture` | Repo structure, dependency graphs, module coupling | Coding |
| `code-review` | Correctness, performance, edge cases, idiomatic patterns | Coding |
| `test` | Test generation — unit, integration, edge cases | Coding |
| `debug` | Bug investigation, root cause analysis, fix proposals | Coding |
| `web` | Browser automation, data extraction, form filling | Web Browsing |
| `desktop` | Screen reading, mouse/keyboard control, app interaction | Computer Use |
| `research` | Multi-source investigation and synthesis | Deep Research |
| `creative` | Ideation, lateral thinking, novel approaches (temp 0.7) | Creativity |

**The One Invariant:** The Main Agent is the sole decision-maker. Cores inform. Cores never steer.

**Design guarantees:**
- **No recursion** — Cores cannot invoke other cores (invoke_core structurally filtered from core tool set)
- **Shared budget** — Cores deduct from the main agent's Arc<BudgetTracker> (lock-free AtomicU64)
- **No max rounds** — Cores run until done, budget is the only constraint
- **Context isolation** — 97% context reduction vs skill.md approach (core research stays in core's session)
- **Parallel invocation** — Multiple cores run simultaneously via execute_tools_parallel
- **User-authorable** — Drop a `.md` file in `~/.temm1e/cores/` with YAML frontmatter + system prompt

**A/B tested (same tasks, same model):**

| Metric | Without Cores | With Cores |
|--------|:---:|:---:|
| Tasks completed | 0/3 | **3/3** |
| Main agent tokens | 361K | **82K** (-77%) |
| Main agent cost | $0.056 | **$0.014** (-75%) |
| Total cost | $0.076 | $0.073 (-4%) |
| Errors | 13 | **6** (-54%) |

**Autonomous invocation verified:** Gemini 3.1 Pro autonomously invokes cores when tasks warrant delegation (2/3 tasks delegated, 1/3 handled inline — correct judgment).

## Interactive TUI

`temm1e tui` gives you a Claude Code-level terminal experience — talk to Tem directly from your terminal with rich markdown rendering, syntax-highlighted code blocks, and real-time agent observability.

```
   +                  *          ╭─ python ─
        /\_/\                    │ def hello():
   *   ( o.o )   +               │     print("hOI!!")
        > ^ <                    │
       /|~~~|\                   │ if __name__ == "__main__":
       ( ♥   )                   │     hello()
   *    ~~   ~~                  ╰───

     T E M M 1 E                tem> write me a hello world
   your local AI agent          ◜ Thinking  2.1s
```

**Features:**
- Arrow-key onboarding wizard (provider + model + personality mode)
- Markdown rendering with **bold**, *italic*, `inline code`, and fenced code blocks
- Syntax highlighting via syntect (Solarized Dark) with bordered code blocks
- Animated thinking indicator showing agent phase (Classifying → Thinking → shell → Finishing)
- 9 slash commands (`/help`, `/model`, `/clear`, `/config`, `/keys`, `/usage`, `/status`, `/compact`, `/quit`)
- File drag-and-drop — drop a file path into the terminal to attach it
- Path and URL highlighting (underlined, clickable)
- Mouse wheel scrolling + PageUp/PageDown through full chat history
- Personality modes: Auto (recommended), Play :3, Work >:3, Pro, None (minimal identity)
- Ctrl+D to exit
- Tem's 7-color palette with truecolor/256-color/NO_COLOR degradation
- Token and cost tracking in the status bar

> **Install globally:** `cp target/release/temm1e ~/.local/bin/temm1e` then run `temm1e tui` from anywhere.

---

## Role-Based Access Control

TEMM1E enforces **two roles** across all messaging channels — so you can safely share your bot with others without giving away the keys to the kingdom.

| Role | What they can do | What they can't do |
|:-----|:-----------------|:-------------------|
| **Admin** | Everything — all commands, all tools, user management | Nothing restricted |
| **User** | Full agent chat, file ops, browser, git, web, skills | `shell`, credential management, system commands |

**How it works:**
- The **first person** to message your bot becomes **Admin** automatically (the owner)
- Add users: `/allow <user_id>` — they get **User** role (safe defaults)
- Promote: `/add_admin <user_id>` — elevate a user to admin
- Demote: `/remove_admin <user_id>` — the original owner can never be demoted

**Three enforcement layers** (defense in depth):
1. **Channel gate** — unknown users are silently rejected
2. **Command gate** — admin-only slash commands blocked before dispatch
3. **Tool gate** — dangerous tools hidden from the LLM entirely (it can't even see them)

Finding user IDs: Telegram (`@userinfobot`), Discord (Developer Mode → Copy User ID), Slack (Profile → Copy member ID), WhatsApp (phone number as digits).

> Full docs: [`docs/RBAC.md`](docs/RBAC.md)

---

## Skills

Tem can discover and invoke **skills** — reusable instruction sets for common tasks. Skills are Markdown files placed in `~/.temm1e/skills/` (global) or `<workspace>/skills/` (per-project).

```bash
temm1e skill list                    # See installed skills
temm1e skill info code-review        # View skill details
temm1e skill install path/to/skill.md  # Install a skill
```

The agent discovers skills via the `use_skill` tool with **three progressive layers** (minimal context overhead):

| Layer | Action | What the agent sees |
|:------|:-------|:-------------------|
| Catalog | `list` | Name + one-line description only |
| Summary | `info` | Version, capabilities, description |
| Full | `invoke` | Complete skill instructions |

**Cross-compatible** with Claude Code — both YAML-frontmatter (TEMM1E native) and plain Markdown (`# Skill: Title`) formats are supported. Skills from either system work in both.
